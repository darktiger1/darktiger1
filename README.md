- 👋 Hi, I’m @darktiger1
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things including but not limited to coding, chemistry, soccer, anime, and a good life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can find related to computer science/software engineering. In that typical excited-to-learn college student phase (although every now and then it's the done-with-life college student phase).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that utilize python. I'm rather confident in my mastery of, at the very least, the basics of python and currently learning/experimenting with intermediate to advanced level python.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord truly does work wonders: darktiger#3845
